        "privacy_def_usage_telemetry": "<strong>Usage and Telemetry Data:</strong> Corresponds to all information that is automatically generated and collected during your interaction with the Platform. It is important to note that this data is anonymous and not linked to your personal identity.

        "privacy_def_user": "<strong>User:</strong> Is any natural person who, freely and voluntarily, accesses, navigates, or uses any of the tools and functionalities offered by the ProjectNocturne Platform through its web domain.",
        "privacy_def_controller": "<strong>Data Controller:</strong> Is the entity that, alone or jointly with others, makes the fundamental decisions about the processing of personal data, including the determination of the purposes (the \"why\") and the means (the \"how\").

As the Data Controller, ProjectNocturne undertakes to ensure that the entire data lifecycle—from collection to eventual deletion—is managed in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, minimization, and confidentiality established herein. Any inquiry about the processing of your data should be directed to the contact channels specified in this document.",

        "privacy_principles_lft": "<strong>Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:</strong> All data processing we carry out is based on a solid and clearly defined legal basis in this policy. We act with the utmost fairness towards our users, which means we will never process your data in ways you would not reasonably expect. Transparency is key: we inform you clearly and accessibly about what data we collect and what we use it for.",
        "privacy_principles_purpose": "<strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> The data we collect is used solely and exclusively for the explicit and legitimate purposes detailed in section 6 of this policy. We are committed to not processing your data for further purposes that are incompatible with those for which it was initially collected, thus ensuring that the information is used in a predictable and respectful manner.",
        "privacy_principles_minimization": "<strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We adopt a \"privacy by design and by default\" approach. This means we only collect the minimum amount of information that is strictly necessary, adequate, and relevant to fulfill each specific purpose. We do not request or collect data that is not essential for the operation and improvement of the Platform.",
        "privacy_principles_security": "<strong>Integrity and Confidentiality:</strong> The security of your data is a critical priority. We implement and maintain a robust set of technical and organizational security measures, such as communication encryption and strict access controls, to protect all information against unauthorized or unlawful processing, as well as against its accidental loss, destruction, or damage.",
        "privacy_data_types_title": "5. Types of Data Collected and Collection Channels",
        "privacy_data_types_intro": "The functionality of the Platform requires the collection of different categories of data, which are broken down below for your full awareness:",

        "privacy_data_types_local_p1": "For ProjectNocturne to be a truly useful and personalized tool, we rely on your browser's local storage technologies (`localStorage` and `IndexedDB`).

        "privacy_data_types_local_li1": "<strong>Tool Configuration (localStorage):</strong> We persistently store the configuration of each alarm, timer, and world clock you create. This includes titles, times, selected sounds, and operational states.",
        "privacy_data_types_local_li2": "<strong>Interface Preferences (localStorage):</strong> We save your customization choices, such as the visual theme (light/dark), text color, and font scale, so that the interface adapts to your liking on each visit.",
        "privacy_data_types_local_li3": "<strong>Custom Audio Files (IndexedDB):</strong> If you use the feature to upload your own sounds for alerts, these files are saved in your browser's `IndexedDB` database. This is local and private storage on your machine; these files are never transferred to our servers.",
        "privacy_data_types_user_title": "<strong>5.2. Data Provided Directly by the User:</strong>",
        "privacy_data_types_user_li1": "<strong>Suggestions and Improvements Form:</strong> When you contact us through the suggestions form, we collect the data you voluntarily provide: your <strong>email address</strong>, the <strong>category of your feedback</strong>, and the <strong>content of your message</strong>.",

        "privacy_data_types_telemetry_p1": "To improve the Platform, we collect usage data anonymously, which does not allow for your personal identification:",
        "privacy_data_types_telemetry_li1": "<strong>Unique Session Identifier (UUID):</strong> We assign an anonymous identifier to your browser (`user-unique-id`) to group usage metrics without collecting personal information.",
        "privacy_data_types_telemetry_li2": "<strong>Event Telemetry:</strong> We record key anonymous interactions with the platform's functionalities. This data is crucial for our usability analysis and for understanding which tools are most valued by our users.",
        "privacy_data_types_telemetry_li3": "<strong>Technical and Geographic Data:</strong> We detect your <strong>country</strong> of origin (without storing your IP), <strong>operating system</strong>, and <strong>web browser</strong> to optimize compatibility and experience.",
        "privacy_purposes_title": "6. Detailed Purposes of Data Processing",
        "privacy_purposes_intro": "The processing of each data category pursues clear, defined, and legitimate objectives, aimed exclusively at the provision and continuous improvement of our services. These purposes are detailed below:",
        "privacy_purposes_op": "<strong>For the Operation and Maintenance of the Service:</strong> The local storage of your settings and preferences is fundamental to the core functionality of the Platform. Without this capability, your custom alarms, timers, world clocks, and design preferences (theme, color, font) would be lost every time you close or refresh the page. This purpose is, therefore, essential to offer you a consistent, persistent, and truly personalized user experience, which is the core of our value proposition.",
        "privacy_purposes_imp": "<strong>For Continuous Improvement and Strategic Analysis:</strong> The collection of telemetry and anonymous usage data is a vital tool for the evolution of ProjectNocturne. This aggregated data allows us to understand how users interact with different tools, which functions are most used, and where points of friction or difficulty may exist. This quantitative analysis guides our development decisions, helps us prioritize new features, optimize existing workflows, and ensure our resources are invested in the areas that provide the most value to our user community.",
        "privacy_purposes_comms": "<strong>For Managing Communications and User Support:</strong> When you send us your comments, suggestions, or bug reports through the contact form, we use the information provided (your email and the content of your message) for the sole purpose of managing that communication. This includes processing your request, investigating the reported issue, answering your questions, and generally providing the support you need. We will not use your email for unsolicited marketing purposes.",
        "privacy_purposes_ux": "<strong>For Personalizing the User Experience:</strong> Beyond the settings you actively save, the Platform performs an initial detection of factors such as your browser's language and your operating system's theme preferences. This information is used to automatically configure the interface to an initial state that is familiar and comfortable for you from the very first moment, reducing the need for manual adjustments and making the Platform feel more intuitive and adapted to your digital environment.",
        "privacy_legal_basis_title": "7. Legal Basis for Processing",
        "privacy_legal_basis_intro": "All data processing we carry out at ProjectNocturne is supported by a solid and transparent legal basis, in accordance with major data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. The legal bases that legitimize our processing activities are as follows:",
        "privacy_legal_basis_consent": "<strong>Your Explicit Consent:</strong> For certain processing activities, our legitimacy is based on the free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent you give us. This is the case when you voluntarily decide to use our suggestion form and provide us with your email address so we can reply to you. Likewise, by accepting our cookie and privacy policy when using the service, you are consenting to the practices described herein. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.",
        "privacy_legal_basis_interest": "<strong>Our Legitimate Interest:</strong> For other activities, the legal basis is our legitimate interest as a company to operate and improve our service. This applies specifically to the collection of anonymous usage and telemetry data. Our legitimate interest consists of understanding how our Platform is used so we can improve it, fix bugs, and make strategic decisions about its future development. We have conducted a balancing test to ensure that this interest does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms, especially since the data is processed anonymously and does not allow for your personal identification.",
        "privacy_retention_title": "8. Data Retention and Deletion Policy",
        "privacy_retention_intro": "At ProjectNocturne, we apply a differentiated and transparent data retention policy, designed to give you maximum control over your information and to ensure that we do not store data longer than is strictly necessary.",
        "privacy_retention_local": "<strong>Local Data (`localStorage` and `IndexedDB`):</strong> This category of data, which includes all your tool settings and interface preferences, resides exclusively on your device, within your web browser's secure storage. <strong>You have full and absolute control over this data.</strong> It remains on your device indefinitely to ensure the persistence of your personalized experience every time you visit the Platform. The deletion of this data is entirely in your hands and can be done at any time through the Browse data cleaning tools offered by your browser (such as \"Clear Browse data\", \"Clear history\", or similar).",
        "privacy_retention_server": "<strong>Server Data (Suggestions and Telemetry):</strong> Information transmitted to our servers, such as data from your suggestion form (including your email) and anonymous usage telemetry, follows a defined lifecycle. This data is retained only for the period essential to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. For example, we will keep the details of a suggestion until it has been processed and answered. Once the purpose has been fulfilled, or if any applicable legal period expires, the data is securely and permanently deleted from our systems.",
        "privacy_rights_title": "9. User Rights and Exercise Mechanisms",

This includes the right to know the purposes of the processing, the categories of data concerned, and the recipients of the data. Since the only personal data we store on the server is your email address (if you contact us), you can request confirmation of its existence and a copy of it.",
        "privacy_rights_rectification": "<strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If you believe that the personal data we may hold about you (such as your email address in the context of a communication) is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request its correction without undue delay.",
        "privacy_rights_erasure": "<strong>Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data. This applies both to data stored locally in your browser (which you can delete directly through your browser's cleaning options) and to data we may have on our servers (such as your email after an inquiry). Upon receiving your request, we will proceed with the secure deletion of your information, provided there is no legal obligation preventing us from doing so.",
        "privacy_rights_objection": "<strong>Right to Restrict and Object to Processing:</strong> In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your data or to object to such processing. For example, you can object to your data (email address) being further processed after a query has been resolved. We will respect your request and cease processing, except for compelling legitimate grounds or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.",
        "privacy_security_title": "10. Implemented Security Measures",

This ensures that information travels across the network confidentially and with integrity.",
        "privacy_security_li2": "<strong>Storage Security:</strong> Data hosted on our server infrastructure, such as anonymous telemetry and suggestions, is stored in databases with strict access controls. Access to these databases is exclusively limited to authorized personnel who need to know the information for the performance of their duties, following the principle of least privilege.",
        "privacy_security_li3": "<strong>Application-Level Security:</strong> Our platform is developed following best practices for secure coding to prevent common vulnerabilities. We conduct regular reviews of our code and dependencies to identify and mitigate potential security breaches.",
        "privacy_security_li4": "<strong>Operational Security:</strong> We have internal information security management policies that govern the access, handling, and protection of data. Personnel with access to systems are aware of their obligations regarding confidentiality and security.",
        "privacy_security_p2": "Despite our commitment and diligence in applying these measures, it is important to recognize that no Internet transmission or electronic storage system is infallible or 100% invulnerable. However, we are committed to continuously maintaining and improving our security practices to adapt to new threats and protect your data with the utmost rigor.",
        "privacy_updates_title": "11. Modifications and Updates to the Privacy Policy",
        "privacy_updates_p1": "The digital environment, technologies, and, very relevantly, regulations on privacy and data protection, are in a constant state of evolution.

        "cookies_s1_title": "1. Preamble and Statement of Principles",
        "cookies_s1_p1": "This Cookies and Local Storage Technologies Policy (hereinafter, \"the Policy\") aims to provide a comprehensive and transparent description of the use of browser storage technologies by the ProjectNocturne web platform (hereinafter, \"the Service\"). This document complements our Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, focusing specifically on the data stored on the user's device to ensure the functionality, personalization, and persistence of the experience. Our operational philosophy is based on a pillar of maximum transparency and respect for user autonomy. Consistent with this principle, we explicitly state that <strong>ProjectNocturne does not use traditional HTTP cookies for tracking, advertising, or third-party analysis purposes.</strong> We do not implement mechanisms that track your behavior outside our domain, nor do we share information with advertising networks or data brokers. The choice to use local storage technologies instead of cookies is a deliberate design decision, aimed at empowering the user by ensuring that their configuration data remains under their exclusive control. Our use of these technologies is irrevocably limited to strictly functional purposes, which are essential for providing a robust, consistent, and highly personalized user experience. Continued interaction with and use of the Service implies knowledge and acceptance of the local storage practices described herein, which are essential for the platform's operation.",
        "cookies_s2_title": "2. Purposes and Categories of Locally Stored Data",
        "cookies_s2_p1": "Storing data in your browser is an indispensable technical requirement for the Service to offer its main functionalities. The categories of data stored and their specific purposes are detailed below:",
        "cookies_s2_ss1_title": "2.1. Persistence of Tool Configuration and Application State",
        "cookies_s2_ss1_p1": "For the Service to transcend the nature of a simple webpage and behave like a persistent application, it is essential to save the state of your interactions. We locally store all the configurations you set in our tools to ensure seamless continuity between sessions. This includes the detailed properties of the <strong>alarms</strong> you create, the duration and sound settings of the <strong>timers</strong>, the list and customization of the <strong>world clocks</strong>, and the entire state of the <strong>stopwatch</strong>, including elapsed time and lap history. Without this functional storage, any configuration would be immediately lost upon closing or refreshing the tab, undermining the fundamental utility of the Service.",
        "cookies_s2_ss2_title": "2.2. Advanced Interface and User Experience Customization",
        "cookies_s2_ss2_p1": "ProjectNocturne offers a high degree of customization to adapt to your aesthetic and usability preferences. To remember and automatically apply this customization on each visit, we locally save the selection of <strong>visual theme</strong> (light, dark, or synchronized with the system), the <strong>interface language</strong>, as well as your <strong>typographic style preferences</strong>, such as the color and format attributes (bold, italic) for the main textual elements. Additionally, a record of <strong>recently used colors</strong> and the <strong>display state (collapsed/expanded)</strong> of the menus is kept to optimize navigation and reduce friction in recurrent use.",
        "cookies_s2_ss3_title": "2.3. User-Generated Content Management",
        "cookies_s2_ss3_p1": "The Service allows you to go beyond the default options by facilitating the upload of your own audio files for notifications. To manage this content securely and privately, we use <code>IndexedDB</code> technology. This means that your <strong>custom audio files</strong> are stored in a local and secure database within your own browser. We emphasize that these files are <strong>not transferred, hosted, or processed on our servers</strong>; they remain under your exclusive control on your device.",
        "cookies_s2_ss4_title": "2.4. Service Optimization Through Anonymous Analytics",
        "cookies_s2_ss4_p1": "For the continuous improvement of ProjectNocturne, we assign a <strong>completely anonymous session identifier</strong> to your browser. This identifier contains no personal information and cannot be used for your identification. Its sole purpose is to allow us to group interaction events in an aggregated manner for internal usability analysis, enabling us to make informed development decisions, always from a perspective of total anonymity.",
        "cookies_s3_title": "3. User Data Management and Deletion",
        "cookies_s3_p1": "In line with our philosophy of empowerment, you, as the user, are the sole custodian and administrator of the data stored locally on your device. We grant you absolute control to manage and delete this information at any time. By doing so, the application will reset to its original state, as if it were your first time visiting.",
        "cookies_s3_p2": "To delete the stored data, you must use the integrated data cleaning tools in your web browser. The general procedure is to go to <strong>Settings</strong>, find the <strong>\"Privacy and security\"</strong> section, and select <strong>\"Clear Browse data\"</strong>. Make sure to select the time range \"All time\" and check the box corresponding to <strong>\"Cookies and other site data\"</strong>. It is important to understand that this action is irreversible and will delete all your saved settings.",

        "cookies_s4_p1": "By using the various functionalities of ProjectNocturne, you give your implied consent and agree to the local storage of the functional data described in this policy. It should be understood that this storage is not optional, but rather constitutes a <strong>strictly necessary</strong> technical prerequisite for the proper functioning of the customization and persistence features that define the fundamental value proposition of the Service. Without these technologies, the platform could not operate as it was designed."
